Description of the project
The project concerns the creation of an app to facilitate the user's search for an available parking slot. The main goal of the app is to make users avoid endless searches for a parking slot; by using this app the user can first view which parking space is free, in particular he/she will be able to locate the free parking space in certain sectors or floors of the parking lot, by doing so he/she will be able to reach the available parking slot optimizing the search. The app offers the user the possibility to select the desired parking slot before his arrival.. In the event that parking is subject to payment, the user can pay by credit card and has the option of extending the duration of your stay via the app; when the parking is about to expire the user will receive a warning notification.

A practical example to use this app can be for example in parking lots in shopping malls where there are also multi-level parking lots, the user therefore can view on the app what floor a parking space is free and directly reach the said floor optimizing the time.

The idea, therefore, is to make the app by going to simulate the parking lots with an ESP32 microcontroller that, through different sensors (which simulate the parking slot), allows to simulate the availability or not of the parking slot.

The aim is to use technology to help people in their daily lives and above all in those actions that would seem obvious but have a great impact on many aspects of peopleâ€™s lives and our society: quality of life, environmental issues (in terms of consumption in continuing to look for a parking space), and time that we can use for other activities.
